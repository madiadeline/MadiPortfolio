        		Growing up, I loved to doodle I still do. I will doodle over everything! Whether it be Phonebooks while i'm making
        		a call, Paperwork while I'm filling out forms, I even doodled on my mirror when I was young, moustaches, crazy 
        		eyebrows and all that jazz.
        		It was a habbit. 
        		But, I really enjoyed it. So I embraced it. I've aways been a sketcher but I enjoy working with charcoal, paint 
        		and other mixed media just as much.</p>
