        	<p><b>Hi, I'm Matty!</b></p>
        	
        			<p>Iâ€™m currently a Creative Studies student at the Otago Polytechnic here in Dunedin who is passionate about Art, 
        			design and creativity. I've aways been a sketcher but I enjoy working with Paint, Charcoal 
        			and other Mixed Media just as much.
        		</p>
        		
        			<p>After working on a senimental piece of art at school, I entered it into my first competition at our local Teviot Valley 
        			art exhibition in 2008 and won! I thought to myself hey, this is an area where I will excel in. 
        			Having both parents who share the shame talent had a wonderful impact on who I am and how I percieve 
        			things. Today my painting sits in the Roxburgh Area School office corridor opposite my 
        			fathers Carving.</p>
        			
        			<p>Growing up, I loved to doodle. I still do, I will doodle over everything. Phone books, paper work, even my mirriors. 
        				It was a habbit. But, I really enjoyed it and I can't wait to jump into an industry 
        			where I can make the most of doing what I love.</p>
        			
        			<p>I also love music, I play guitar and sing alot! Despite what my neighbors and the rest of the world think, (I think
        				I sound great!) Music is another form of story telling and as long as I still have my
